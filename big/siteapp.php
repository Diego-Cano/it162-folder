<p>A responsive website is coded in a way that makes web pages render well on a variety of devices and windows or screen sizes. Whereas, a mobile app is coded for a particular OS with predetermined  screen sizes. Both options take different approaches targeting specific audiences, so it depends on what your needs are when deciding what is the best alternative.</p>

<p>“Ideally, both. Even if your website is already responsive, in time, you may need to create an app, too. Instagram uses both a responsive website and an application, giving its users a choice of how to access the content. Still, you can’t upload photos on the Instagram website, only view them. Some app features aren’t available on websites because of tech reasons—you need to download the app to get full access.”</p>
<p>Furthemore, mobile apps offer a more personalized experience to users because it has advantages over responsive websites. “Native apps work faster. Well-written native code always performs better than a responsive web code. That’s because mobile apps can store data on devices’ file systems and not rely on a linking processor (your web browser) to perform the most elementary functions.” [capturly.com]</p>
