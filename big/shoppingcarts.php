<p>“A shopping cart on an online retailer's site is a piece of software that facilitates the purchase of a product or service. It accepts the customer's payment and organizes the distribution of that information to the merchant, payment processor and other parties. Shopping carts bridge the gap between shopping and buying, so having the best shopping cart software is extremely important for a website.” - </p>

<p>Furthermore, website administrators count with two different options for adding shopping carts to their websites. As bigcommerce.com says on its website, you can either have a licenced shopping cart or a hosted shopping cart.  “Licensed shopping carts: This type of solution allows business owners to build their own type of cart and customize it to their specific needs. There is much greater flexibility in changing features and functionality, as well as in adding third-party tools if need be. However, the upfront costs are often higher and require more hands-on expertise for troubleshooting issues and technical support.” - (bigcommerce.com)</p>
<p>“Hosted shopping carts: A third-party firm "hosts" the solution and is responsible for server backups, maintenance and upgrades. The beauty of a hosted solution is that hosting comes free, which means it doesn't cost anything for the third party to keep your site functional on the Web. The main drawback with hosted solutions is that customers will be directed to another domain for payment processing.” - (bigcommerce.com)</p>
<p>On one hand, hosted solutions are a great option for new websites/businesses . It makes the process easier for the company and/or developer. On the other hand, licensed shopping carts can have advanced features that hosted shopping carts wouldn’t.  “Hosted solutions are often recommended for those who are beginning their own venture because they require less technical expertise. That's not to say all new online retail store owners aren't adept in IT, but a hosted solution may free up time to focus on other aspects of operations. There are numerous providers of shopping cart software on the market today, and companies must first evaluate their individual needs before making a final decision on which solution is best for them.”  - (bigcommerce.com)</p>
<p>In addition, You could build your own shopping cart from scratch. As Zand says on smashingmagazine.com,   It would require the developer to be either familiarized with a server-side language or a client-side language. “A shopping cart allows a website’s visitor to view product pages and add items to their basket. The visitor can review all of their items and update their basket (such as to add or remove items). To achieve this, the website needs to store the visitor’s data and pass them from one page to another, until the visitor goes to the checkout page and makes a purchase. Storing data can be done via a server-side language or a client-side one. With a server-side language, the server bears the weight of the data storage, whereas with a client-side language, the visitor’s computer (desktop, tablet or smartphone) stores and processes the data. Online e-commerce websites predominantly use server-side languages such as PHP to store users’ data and pass them from one page to another. Using JavaScript back-end frameworks such as Node.js, we can achieve the same goal.” -</p>
