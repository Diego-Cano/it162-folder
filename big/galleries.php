<p>“If you are a web designer or developer, then there is a huge possibility that you might have heard about Image Galleries. HTML, CSS  galleries are image galleries constructed with the help of HTML, CSS and JavaScript languages.” -  </p>

<p>“Galleries are a popular way of integrating images into a website, allowing users to see several images clearly at once. There are several diverse methods of generating slide shows such as these, including embedding a simple Lightbox gallery in your website with a source code and implementing the photo gallery via HTML. Another, even simpler method involves using a popular content management system. To do this with a system like TYPO3 or WordPress, users just need to find the right extension and integrate it into the basic framework.” - </p>

<p>Integrating an image gallery into your website could improve your users’ experience. As ionos.com says on its website, you could be losing users just by having too much content.  “Large blocks of text can often scare visitors off before they even read the content. Graphics and images are therefore hugely important elements of any website, whether they’re used to illustrate a text, to create a personal or emotional bond with the user, or to visualize the details of a product.” -  (ionos)</p>
<p>“Adding an HTML photo gallery to your site will not only make your page more attractive but will also engage your visitors and increase the time they spend on page. Great pictures provoke comments, especially when they are displayed on a stylish template that enables Cooliris view and lots of transitions and customization options.” - </p>

<p>If you want to integrate an image gallery into your webpage/code, you got to choose a method. As mentioned before, you could either use a CMS, library or copy and paste code from  the web. But what is the best method when it comes down to simplicity and reliability?. Well, it depends on your website needs and expectations. As long as you get familiar with the gallery’s layout, you can modify it to suit your project.</p>
