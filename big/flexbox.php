<p>“The Flexbox Layout (Flexible Box) module (a W3C Candidate Recommendation as of October 2017) aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word “flex”).” - </p>

<p>Since its release Fle-box has become one of the most popular css options for  web designing. As Coyier says on his website, the ability of altering items within a container is the whole point of using Flexbox. “The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items’ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate all kinds of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow. Items will be laid out following either the main axis (from main-start to main-end) or the cross axis (from cross-start to cross-end)”- (Coyier)</p>
<p>Even though the idea of Flexbox sounds easy, it has multiple properties for its container and items.  “Since flexbox is a whole module and not a single property, it involves a lot of things including its whole set of properties. Some of them are meant to be set on the container (parent element, known as flex container) whereas the others are meant to be set on the children (said flex items).” - (Coyier)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Flexbox has problems with browser support, making it useless for some older browsers. As Sean Patnode says on quora.com, browser flexbox support is available in most  new browsers. “Flexbox support is available in most new browsers — Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Microsoft Edge and IE 11, newer versions of Android/iOS, etc. However you should be aware that there are still older browsers in use that don't support Flexbox (or do, but support a really old, out-of-date version of it.)” - </p>
